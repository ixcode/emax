;; This keyboard layout is focused on the core of editing on a mac
;; Therefore it prioritises mac familiar key shortcuts.

;; The goal here is to try and preserve the "OSX" experience so that you don't have to remap the world.

;; The next most useful key in emacs is the META key, so we bind that to the right option key
;; It's the right because most common is M-x and that allows you to type it with opposite hands

;; By default on os x, 'super' is mapped to copy, paste etc, like s-x, s-c, s-v, s-z
;; modifier settings can be: [control | meta | alt | super | hyper]

(fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p) ;; "y or n" instead of "yes or no"

;; To allow window switching easy:
(defun select-next-window ()
  "Switch to the next window"
  (interactive)
  (select-window (next-window)))

(defun select-previous-window ()
  "Switch to the previous window"
  (interactive)
  (select-window (previous-window)))
